### About Me 

I'm currently working as a Robotic engineer at Redwire Space Europe.

I did my first year in [Universit√† di Trento](https://www.unitn.it/) and the last year at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/) as exit university.

I have a background in Computer Science developed during my bachelor and my work experiences. I aim to create innovative solutions that impact people. Moreover, I'm very passionate about astronomy, space exploration and aerospace in general.
### Current goal ‚ö°
I'm interested in everything about Autonomous System, in particular robotics, Machine learning and embedded system. I would love to find work in the Space industry.
