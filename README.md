### About Me 

I'm currently enrolled in the last year of the [EIT Digital](https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/) double degree master in Autonomous System with a minor in Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship. I did my first year of my current master in [Università di Trento](https://www.unitn.it/) and I'm currently attending my second and last year at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/) as the exit university.

I have a background in Computer Science developed during my bachelor and my work experiences. I aim to create innovative solutions that impact people. Moreover, I'm very passionate about astronomy, space exploration and aerospace in general.
### Current goal ⚡
I'm interested in everything about Autonomous System, in particular robotics, Machine learning and embedded system. I would love to find work in the Space industry.
